OVERVIEW
INF2009F is a half course designed for students intending to major in Information Systems or
Computer Science for the BCom, BBusSci or Bsc degrees, although students pursuing other
computing degrees may be accepted, space permitting.
This course is intended to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the front end of
the systems development life cycle. There are some practical components to the course, where
students will be taught to use the common tools of systems analysis. These tools and techniques
include scoping, risk analysis, feasibility assessment, and techniques commonly used in object

oriented systems modeling including package, activity, use case, class, interaction and state
machine diagrams. Mastering the systems development process is both a complex and time
consuming exercise and the course follows a three stage approach to developing the required
proficiency:
• Stage 1 is to understand the theory and body of knowledge underpinning the systems
development process, particularly the systems analysis phase. This will be achieved
through the flipped classroom approach, where students will be provided with short
videos, lecture notes and important reading materials. The lecture will then be dedicated
to short class exercises, discussions and brainstorming sessions.
• Stage 2 is to work in groups to apply the theory to a real world example. This will be done
in the workshops where students step through the problem solving process with the
support of tutors where required.
• Stage 3 is to work together in your teams of two, in your own time, to complete each
exercise started in the workshops in order to develop the two main deliverables for the
course – a Business Case and User Requirements Specification.
INF2009F is closely linked to INF2011S and students continuing to this second semester course
will implement parts of an information system based on these user requirements. In doing so a
candidate enrolled for both courses will have completed the whole systems development life
cycle (SDLC) by the end of the year.
It is important to note that although this course includes substantial theoretical content that
students are required to master, students will be expected to apply the acquired theoretical
knowledge in exams, workshops and class exercises to solve real-world problems. The
underlying purpose is always to link theory and practice, preparing students for professional
practice at the end of their studies.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES
On completion of this module the student should be able to:
• Understand the main concepts supporting the Object Oriented paradigm including classes
and instances, association, encapsulation, message-passing, information hiding,
collaboration, aggregation and inheritance.
• Explain the key role of a Systems Analyst/Business Analyst in business.
• Understand and describe the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and how it can be
used to manage the systems development effort.
• Describe the context of the analysis, design and implementation stages within the SDLC.
• Describe the different overall approaches used to develop information systems.
• Explain the many reasons for creating Information Systems models.
• Develop a Business Case to identify problems in a particular business area and context
and to recommend a strategy to solving these problems.
• Document functional requirements with Use Case diagrams and Use Case narratives.
• Model workflows and business processes using Activity diagrams.
• Develop a Domain Class Diagram to document the major concepts in the system and refine
this model to represent the logical software classes (Analysis Class Diagram)
• Realise Use Case interactions using Sequence diagrams.
• Document message passing at the user interface using System Sequence Diagrams and
object behaviour using State Machine diagrams.
• Understand how the various tools and techniques relate to each other.

• Develop a detailed User Requirements Specification document.
CONTENT AND TEACHING FORMAT
Lectures
The Lectures follow a Flipped Classroom Model. Lectures will comprise of class exercises, group
discussion and brainstorming sessions. Students are thus required to watch the videos and
cover the notes available on Vula prior to the lecture, to fully and productively engage with
the class exercises and discussion sessions.
The topics to be covered are listed in the lecture schedule document and the Vula Lesson Plans.
PLEASE NOTE: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE COURSE MATERIAL, TUTORIALS,
TESTS, EXAMS AND PROJECTS, WILL BE MADE DURING LECTURES AND WORKSHOPS FROM
TIME TO TIME. WHILE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE POSTED ON THE INF2009F
VULA SITE, STUDENTS WHO SKIP LECTURES DO SO AT THEIR OWN RISK.
Workshops
Students will be working in teams of two for the project and in groups of four in the workshops
(two teams together). Weekly workshop sessions will be held on most Thursdays (see detailed
schedule for exact dates) as follows:
• Option 1: 3rd & 4th – SNAPE DO 2
• Option 2: 4th & 5th – CS203
• Option 3: 8th & 9th – JORDAN 1C
At the end of each workshop each group will submit a solution for review and which will be
returned at the next workshop. Marks obtained from the workshop submissions will count
towards the end-of-year mark.
PLEASE NOTE: STUDENTS WHO FAIL TO ATTEND AT LEAST 80% OF WORKSHOPS WILL BE
REFUSED PERMISSION TO WRITE THE FINAL EXAM (DPR).
Class Exercises
Students will be required to complete class exercises which counts 10% of the final marks. 80%
of the class exercises should be completed for DP. Class Exercises are to be submitted at the end
of the lecture. Formative feedback will be given for each submission.
Late submissions will not be accepted.
Projects and Assignments
Students will be required to complete the analysis phase of a significant systems development
project. This will entail the construction of two documents (a Business Case and a User
Requirements Specification document). Students will work in teams in the workshops and in
their own time to complete their project assignments. Based on the analysis completed in
INF2009F, students will design and implement an information system in the second semester
(INF2011S) in order to complete the whole systems development life cycle (SDLC).
Examinations and Tests
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 4
There is a two-hour test scheduled on the 25th of April at 16:00 and a three-hour final examination
in June (dates will be published later). Exams and tests are not open-book.
COURSE MATERIALS
The recommended text for the course is:
Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design in a Changing World, 7th Edition
by John W. Satzinger, Robert B. Jackson, Stephen D. Burd
Other suitable texts may be recommended during lectures. Notes deemed necessary will be made
available during lectures and workshops throughout the course. Students are required to cover
ALL course related material posted on the Vula site (specifically the Lesson plans). These would
include short videos, articles, lecture notes and book chapters. It is important that students
familiarise themselves of the theoretical content contained in these elements, PRIOR to the
lecture.
STUDENT DELIVERABLES
The deliverables (quizzes, class exercises, workshops and the two major assignments) as
specified above, need to be submitted electronically on Vula. No exemptions will be granted and
all deliverables need to be handed in for DP purposes. Students need to read the department and
UCT guide to plagiarism and acknowledge the plagiarism declaration for all deliverables.
Due dates for all deliverables are documented in the schedule and on the individual assignment
handouts. In the interests of those students who plan their work well and work efficiently and
steadily throughout the course, absolutely no individual extensions will be given on any
deadlines, for any reason whatsoever. In cases where substantial and unavoidable disruption
to the academic year has occurred, deadlines may be altered for the entire class, at the discretion
of the course co-ordinator.
Deliverables submitted on, or before, the deadline will be marked without penalty. Deliverables
handed in after deadlines will incur an automatic and non-negotiable penalty deduction of 5%
per day, or part thereof. Deliverables handed in more than five days late will not be marked and
the student will receive 0%.
ASSESSMENT
There is a mid-semester test and a final examination at the end of the course. If a student is
exempted for the test, the weight of this mark will be added to the final examination. The graded
activities and percentage contribution towards the final mark is as follows.
Activity Percentage
Workshops 10%
Class Exercises, quizzes 10%
April Test 15%
Assignments 15%
Final Examination 50%
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 5
DP REQUIREMENTS
In order to be permitted to sit the final exam in INF2009F students must have:
• attended and participated in at least 80 % of the workshops
• submitted at least 80% of the class exercises
• completed at least 80% of quizzes
• obtained a sub-minimum of 40% for their year mark prior to the final exam
• submitted all project work
In order to pass INF2009F students must
• Obtain a sub-minimum of 45% in the final examination
• Obtain 50% overall for the course
Please note that 65% of the course mark is obtained under exam conditions; and where a student
is exempted from the term test, their final exam weighting will be increased to 65%.
Students who are thinking of proceeding to IS Honours: should be aiming to average at least 65%
in the IS2 and IS3 semester courses to be reasonably sure of being offered a place on the Honours
course.
ACADEMIC HONESTY
Your attention is drawn to the UCT regulations, which govern academic progress. In particular,
your attention is drawn to:
1. All forms of cheating, plagiarism, collusion or interference with other students’ academic
work and performance will be reported to the Head of Department who will:
a. Impose a penalty with respect to the assessment of the course, or
b. If considered an act of grave misconduct, refer the case to the Tribunal.
All students are responsible to inform themselves about these regulations before performing any
academic work. See the Senate policy on plagiarism.
The Department of Information Systems considers plagiarism to be the deliberate passing off
of another person’s work as though it was your own, and will NOT be tolerated. At the very
least, you would get zero for your work, and we would request that you withdraw from the
Information Systems major. In cases where blatant copying has taken place, we would take
disciplinary action, which could result in suspension or expulsion from UCT.
Since so much of the course mark is awarded for work done outside of our direct control, a great
deal of trust is involved. We therefore view plagiarism in the same way as we do cheating in
examinations. Similar rules apply to all student work such as projects, essays and other
assignments.
Some examples of what we would consider to be plagiarism are:
• You downloaded material from the Internet and submitted it as your own work.
• You acquired assignments from previous year’s students and used them as your own
work.
• Someone else wrote all (or part of) the assignment or project for you, either as a favour
or for some kind of reward.

LAB RULES AND POLICIES
Please respect other students when using the Alumni labs. Students are expected to keep noise
levels down to acceptable standards. All students are responsible to inform themselves about the
Appropriate Use of Computer Facilities policy. Students must obey the lab rules and defer to the
lab supervisor at all times.
Note: This course outline is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by
the instructor may be necessary.
GETTING THROUGH INF2009F
Some students approach a course believing that they can get through just by working hard at the
end of the semester to prepare for the final exams. INF2009F covers too much work for this to
be a sensible approach, and such students will usually fail. The emphasis in workshops and exams
is on applying theoretical knowledge, not regurgitating it! An attempt to study at the end of the
course without having applied the various tools and techniques doesn’t really help. If you have
not worked steadily through the workshops and the assignments during the semester, you will
find the examinations incomprehensible.
On the other hand, students who work hard throughout the course should approach the final
exam with a good year mark, and a comfortable feeling that they are already on top of the subject!
Revising for the final exam is still necessary, but it becomes more of a process of refreshing your
memory rather than grappling with new and difficult techniques.
Key success factors to making INF2009F one of the most worthwhile and enjoyable courses you
will do in your degree are:
• Attend lectures, even if you have had a late night, or don’t find all the lectures stimulating.
• Complete class exercises and engage in class discussions.
• Attend workshops. They are the best way to move from theory to practice and ensure you
can apply the required techniques. If you find them easy, then this is an indicator that the
exams will not be difficult for you.
• Do your two project assignments as well as you can. A good year mark takes lots of
pressure off you.
• DONT PROCRASTINATE. Start working on your assignments as soon as you receive them.
Remember that there are no extensions. Also, remember that there is strong demand for
computer laboratory resources towards deadlines.
• Speak to your lecturer or tutor EARLY if you are having problems with the material. But
don’t go to them at the last minute when it is too late to remedy the situation.
• Form a study group with fellow students so that you can support each other and help each
other with difficult parts of the course.
• We encourage group discussion and support, but it is important that each student works
with and understands every aspect of the course. Students will be using the tools and
techniques introduced in INF2009F in delivering a major project in third year and
honours. Your expertise in systems development is probably the most critical skill set
you will take out of university into the IT profession. It is therefore important that both
members of a team work on all parts of every deliverable – don’t split the work between
you so that each member can see half the total picture. Obviously one team member might
complete the final drawing of a particular model, but both should be involved in the rough
drafts where the real understanding happens.
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 7
• Beware PLAGARISM. Each team must submit its own documentation. It is very easy to
see where students are copying rather than doing their own work as each marker
evaluates the same section across all the deliverables. Where groups are found to have
copied from other students, both groups will be penalised. This is likely to result in a
mark of zero being given to both groups with the potential for further action where
appropriate. You will be required to submit a declaration saying the deliverable is all
your own work and details of the format of this statement will follow later. Visit UCT
web site to familiarise yourself with the university’s plagiarism policies.

evaluates the same section across all the deliverables. Where groups are found to have
copied from other students, both groups will be penalised. This is likely to result in a
mark of zero being given to both groups with the potential for further action where
appropriate. You will be required to submit a declaration saying the deliverable is all
your own work and details of the format of this statement will follow later. Visit UCT

OVERVIEW
INF2009F is a half course designed for students intending to major in Information Systems or
Computer Science for the BCom, BBusSci or Bsc degrees, although students pursuing other
computing degrees may be accepted, space permitting.
This course is intended to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the front end of
the systems development life cycle. There are some practical components to the course, where
students will be taught to use the common tools of systems analysis. These tools and techniques
include scoping, risk analysis, feasibility assessment, and techniques commonly used in object

oriented systems modeling including package, activity, use case, class, interaction and state
machine diagrams. Mastering the systems development process is both a complex and time
consuming exercise and the course follows a three stage approach to developing the required
proficiency:
• Stage 1 is to understand the theory and body of knowledge underpinning the systems
development process, particularly the systems analysis phase. This will be achieved
through the flipped classroom approach, where students will be provided with short
videos, lecture notes and important reading materials. The lecture will then be dedicated
to short class exercises, discussions and brainstorming sessions.
• Stage 2 is to work in groups to apply the theory to a real world example. This will be done
in the workshops where students step through the problem solving process with the
support of tutors where required.
• Stage 3 is to work together in your teams of two, in your own time, to complete each
exercise started in the workshops in order to develop the two main deliverables for the
course – a Business Case and User Requirements Specification.
INF2009F is closely linked to INF2011S and students continuing to this second semester course
will implement parts of an information system based on these user requirements. In doing so a
candidate enrolled for both courses will have completed the whole systems development life
cycle (SDLC) by the end of the year.
It is important to note that although this course includes substantial theoretical content that
students are required to master, students will be expected to apply the acquired theoretical
knowledge in exams, workshops and class exercises to solve real-world problems. The
underlying purpose is always to link theory and practice, preparing students for professional
practice at the end of their studies.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES
On completion of this module the student should be able to:
• Understand the main concepts supporting the Object Oriented paradigm including classes
and instances, association, encapsulation, message-passing, information hiding,
collaboration, aggregation and inheritance.
• Explain the key role of a Systems Analyst/Business Analyst in business.
• Understand and describe the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and how it can be
used to manage the systems development effort.
• Describe the context of the analysis, design and implementation stages within the SDLC.
• Describe the different overall approaches used to develop information systems.
• Explain the many reasons for creating Information Systems models.
• Develop a Business Case to identify problems in a particular business area and context
and to recommend a strategy to solving these problems.
• Document functional requirements with Use Case diagrams and Use Case narratives.
• Model workflows and business processes using Activity diagrams.
• Develop a Domain Class Diagram to document the major concepts in the system and refine
this model to represent the logical software classes (Analysis Class Diagram)
• Realise Use Case interactions using Sequence diagrams.
• Document message passing at the user interface using System Sequence Diagrams and
object behaviour using State Machine diagrams.
• Understand how the various tools and techniques relate to each other.

• Develop a detailed User Requirements Specification document.
CONTENT AND TEACHING FORMAT
Lectures
The Lectures follow a Flipped Classroom Model. Lectures will comprise of class exercises, group
discussion and brainstorming sessions. Students are thus required to watch the videos and
cover the notes available on Vula prior to the lecture, to fully and productively engage with
the class exercises and discussion sessions.
The topics to be covered are listed in the lecture schedule document and the Vula Lesson Plans.
PLEASE NOTE: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE COURSE MATERIAL, TUTORIALS,
TESTS, EXAMS AND PROJECTS, WILL BE MADE DURING LECTURES AND WORKSHOPS FROM
TIME TO TIME. WHILE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE POSTED ON THE INF2009F
VULA SITE, STUDENTS WHO SKIP LECTURES DO SO AT THEIR OWN RISK.
Workshops
Students will be working in teams of two for the project and in groups of four in the workshops
(two teams together). Weekly workshop sessions will be held on most Thursdays (see detailed
schedule for exact dates) as follows:
• Option 1: 3rd & 4th – SNAPE DO 2
• Option 2: 4th & 5th – CS203
• Option 3: 8th & 9th – JORDAN 1C
At the end of each workshop each group will submit a solution for review and which will be
returned at the next workshop. Marks obtained from the workshop submissions will count
towards the end-of-year mark.
PLEASE NOTE: STUDENTS WHO FAIL TO ATTEND AT LEAST 80% OF WORKSHOPS WILL BE
REFUSED PERMISSION TO WRITE THE FINAL EXAM (DPR).
Class Exercises
Students will be required to complete class exercises which counts 10% of the final marks. 80%
of the class exercises should be completed for DP. Class Exercises are to be submitted at the end
of the lecture. Formative feedback will be given for each submission.
Late submissions will not be accepted.
Projects and Assignments
Students will be required to complete the analysis phase of a significant systems development
project. This will entail the construction of two documents (a Business Case and a User
Requirements Specification document). Students will work in teams in the workshops and in
their own time to complete their project assignments. Based on the analysis completed in
INF2009F, students will design and implement an information system in the second semester
(INF2011S) in order to complete the whole systems development life cycle (SDLC).
Examinations and Tests
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 4
There is a two-hour test scheduled on the 25th of April at 16:00 and a three-hour final examination
in June (dates will be published later). Exams and tests are not open-book.
COURSE MATERIALS
The recommended text for the course is:
Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design in a Changing World, 7th Edition
by John W. Satzinger, Robert B. Jackson, Stephen D. Burd
Other suitable texts may be recommended during lectures. Notes deemed necessary will be made
available during lectures and workshops throughout the course. Students are required to cover
ALL course related material posted on the Vula site (specifically the Lesson plans). These would
include short videos, articles, lecture notes and book chapters. It is important that students
familiarise themselves of the theoretical content contained in these elements, PRIOR to the
lecture.
STUDENT DELIVERABLES
The deliverables (quizzes, class exercises, workshops and the two major assignments) as
specified above, need to be submitted electronically on Vula. No exemptions will be granted and
all deliverables need to be handed in for DP purposes. Students need to read the department and
UCT guide to plagiarism and acknowledge the plagiarism declaration for all deliverables.
Due dates for all deliverables are documented in the schedule and on the individual assignment
handouts. In the interests of those students who plan their work well and work efficiently and
steadily throughout the course, absolutely no individual extensions will be given on any
deadlines, for any reason whatsoever. In cases where substantial and unavoidable disruption
to the academic year has occurred, deadlines may be altered for the entire class, at the discretion
of the course co-ordinator.
Deliverables submitted on, or before, the deadline will be marked without penalty. Deliverables
handed in after deadlines will incur an automatic and non-negotiable penalty deduction of 5%
per day, or part thereof. Deliverables handed in more than five days late will not be marked and
the student will receive 0%.
ASSESSMENT
There is a mid-semester test and a final examination at the end of the course. If a student is
exempted for the test, the weight of this mark will be added to the final examination. The graded
activities and percentage contribution towards the final mark is as follows.
Activity Percentage
Workshops 10%
Class Exercises, quizzes 10%
April Test 15%
Assignments 15%
Final Examination 50%
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 5
DP REQUIREMENTS
In order to be permitted to sit the final exam in INF2009F students must have:
• attended and participated in at least 80 % of the workshops
• submitted at least 80% of the class exercises
• completed at least 80% of quizzes
• obtained a sub-minimum of 40% for their year mark prior to the final exam
• submitted all project work
In order to pass INF2009F students must
• Obtain a sub-minimum of 45% in the final examination
• Obtain 50% overall for the course
Please note that 65% of the course mark is obtained under exam conditions; and where a student
is exempted from the term test, their final exam weighting will be increased to 65%.
Students who are thinking of proceeding to IS Honours: should be aiming to average at least 65%
in the IS2 and IS3 semester courses to be reasonably sure of being offered a place on the Honours
course.
ACADEMIC HONESTY
Your attention is drawn to the UCT regulations, which govern academic progress. In particular,
your attention is drawn to:
1. All forms of cheating, plagiarism, collusion or interference with other students’ academic
work and performance will be reported to the Head of Department who will:
a. Impose a penalty with respect to the assessment of the course, or
b. If considered an act of grave misconduct, refer the case to the Tribunal.
All students are responsible to inform themselves about these regulations before performing any
academic work. See the Senate policy on plagiarism.
The Department of Information Systems considers plagiarism to be the deliberate passing off
of another person’s work as though it was your own, and will NOT be tolerated. At the very
least, you would get zero for your work, and we would request that you withdraw from the
Information Systems major. In cases where blatant copying has taken place, we would take
disciplinary action, which could result in suspension or expulsion from UCT.
Since so much of the course mark is awarded for work done outside of our direct control, a great
deal of trust is involved. We therefore view plagiarism in the same way as we do cheating in
examinations. Similar rules apply to all student work such as projects, essays and other
assignments.
Some examples of what we would consider to be plagiarism are:
• You downloaded material from the Internet and submitted it as your own work.
• You acquired assignments from previous year’s students and used them as your own
work.
• Someone else wrote all (or part of) the assignment or project for you, either as a favour
or for some kind of reward.

INF2009F 6
LAB RULES AND POLICIES
Please respect other students when using the Alumni labs. Students are expected to keep noise
levels down to acceptable standards. All students are responsible to inform themselves about the
Appropriate Use of Computer Facilities policy. Students must obey the lab rules and defer to the
lab supervisor at all times.
Note: This course outline is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by
the instructor may be necessary.
GETTING THROUGH INF2009F
Some students approach a course believing that they can get through just by working hard at the
end of the semester to prepare for the final exams. INF2009F covers too much work for this to
be a sensible approach, and such students will usually fail. The emphasis in workshops and exams
is on applying theoretical knowledge, not regurgitating it! An attempt to study at the end of the
course without having applied the various tools and techniques doesn’t really help. If you have
not worked steadily through the workshops and the assignments during the semester, you will
find the examinations incomprehensible.
On the other hand, students who work hard throughout the course should approach the final
exam with a good year mark, and a comfortable feeling that they are already on top of the subject!
Revising for the final exam is still necessary, but it becomes more of a process of refreshing your
memory rather than grappling with new and difficult techniques.
Key success factors to making INF2009F one of the most worthwhile and enjoyable courses you
will do in your degree are:
• Attend lectures, even if you have had a late night, or don’t find all the lectures stimulating.
• Complete class exercises and engage in class discussions.
• Attend workshops. They are the best way to move from theory to practice and ensure you
can apply the required techniques. If you find them easy, then this is an indicator that the
exams will not be difficult for you.
• Do your two project assignments as well as you can. A good year mark takes lots of
pressure off you.
• DONT PROCRASTINATE. Start working on your assignments as soon as you receive them.
Remember that there are no extensions. Also, remember that there is strong demand for
computer laboratory resources towards deadlines.
• Speak to your lecturer or tutor EARLY if you are having problems with the material. But
don’t go to them at the last minute when it is too late to remedy the situation.
• Form a study group with fellow students so that you can support each other and help each
other with difficult parts of the course.
• We encourage group discussion and support, but it is important that each student works
with and understands every aspect of the course. Students will be using the tools and
techniques introduced in INF2009F in delivering a major project in third year and
honours. Your expertise in systems development is probably the most critical skill set
you will take out of university into the IT profession. It is therefore important that both
members of a team work on all parts of every deliverable – don’t split the work between
you so that each member can see half the total picture. Obviously one team member might
complete the final drawing of a particular model, but both should be involved in the rough
drafts where the real understanding happens.

techniques introduced in INF2009F in delivering a major project in third year and
honours. Your expertise in systems development is probably the most critical skill set
you will take out of university into the IT profession. It is therefore important that both
members of a team work on all parts of every deliverable – don’t split the work between
you so that each member can see half the total picture. Obviously one team member might
complete the final drawing of a particular model, but both should be involved in the rough
drafts where the real understanding happens.

• Beware PLAGARISM. Each team must submit its own documentation. It is very easy to
see where students are copying rather than doing their own work as each marker
evaluates the same section across all the deliverables. Where groups are found to have
copied from other students, both groups will be penalised. This is likely to result in a
mark of zero being given to both groups with the potential for further action where
appropriate. You will be required to submit a declaration saying the deliverable is all
your own work and details of the format of this statement will follow later. Visit UCT

OVERVIEW
INF2009F is a half course designed for students intending to major in Information Systems or
Computer Science for the BCom, BBusSci or Bsc degrees, although students pursuing other
computing degrees may be accepted, space permitting.
This course is intended to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the front end of
the systems development life cycle. There are some practical components to the course, where
students will be taught to use the common tools of systems analysis. These tools and techniques
include scoping, risk analysis, feasibility assessment, and techniques commonly used in object

INF2009F 2
oriented systems modeling including package, activity, use case, class, interaction and state
machine diagrams. Mastering the systems development process is both a complex and time
consuming exercise and the course follows a three stage approach to developing the required
proficiency:
• Stage 1 is to understand the theory and body of knowledge underpinning the systems
development process, particularly the systems analysis phase. This will be achieved
through the flipped classroom approach, where students will be provided with short
videos, lecture notes and important reading materials. The lecture will then be dedicated
to short class exercises, discussions and brainstorming sessions.
• Stage 2 is to work in groups to apply the theory to a real world example. This will be done
in the workshops where students step through the problem solving process with the
support of tutors where required.
• Stage 3 is to work together in your teams of two, in your own time, to complete each
exercise started in the workshops in order to develop the two main deliverables for the
course – a Business Case and User Requirements Specification.
INF2009F is closely linked to INF2011S and students continuing to this second semester course
will implement parts of an information system based on these user requirements. In doing so a
candidate enrolled for both courses will have completed the whole systems development life
cycle (SDLC) by the end of the year.
It is important to note that although this course includes substantial theoretical content that
students are required to master, students will be expected to apply the acquired theoretical
knowledge in exams, workshops and class exercises to solve real-world problems. The
underlying purpose is always to link theory and practice, preparing students for professional
practice at the end of their studies.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES
On completion of this module the student should be able to:
• Understand the main concepts supporting the Object Oriented paradigm including classes
and instances, association, encapsulation, message-passing, information hiding,
collaboration, aggregation and inheritance.
• Explain the key role of a Systems Analyst/Business Analyst in business.
• Understand and describe the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and how it can be
used to manage the systems development effort.
• Describe the context of the analysis, design and implementation stages within the SDLC.
• Describe the different overall approaches used to develop information systems.
• Explain the many reasons for creating Information Systems models.
• Develop a Business Case to identify problems in a particular business area and context
and to recommend a strategy to solving these problems.
• Document functional requirements with Use Case diagrams and Use Case narratives.
• Model workflows and business processes using Activity diagrams.
• Develop a Domain Class Diagram to document the major concepts in the system and refine
this model to represent the logical software classes (Analysis Class Diagram)
• Realise Use Case interactions using Sequence diagrams.
• Document message passing at the user interface using System Sequence Diagrams and
object behaviour using State Machine diagrams.
• Understand how the various tools and techniques relate to each other.

• Develop a detailed User Requirements Specification document.
CONTENT AND TEACHING FORMAT
Lectures
The Lectures follow a Flipped Classroom Model. Lectures will comprise of class exercises, group
discussion and brainstorming sessions. Students are thus required to watch the videos and
cover the notes available on Vula prior to the lecture, to fully and productively engage with
the class exercises and discussion sessions.
The topics to be covered are listed in the lecture schedule document and the Vula Lesson Plans.
PLEASE NOTE: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE COURSE MATERIAL, TUTORIALS,
TESTS, EXAMS AND PROJECTS, WILL BE MADE DURING LECTURES AND WORKSHOPS FROM
TIME TO TIME. WHILE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE POSTED ON THE INF2009F
VULA SITE, STUDENTS WHO SKIP LECTURES DO SO AT THEIR OWN RISK.
Workshops
Students will be working in teams of two for the project and in groups of four in the workshops
(two teams together). Weekly workshop sessions will be held on most Thursdays (see detailed
schedule for exact dates) as follows:
• Option 1: 3rd & 4th – SNAPE DO 2
• Option 2: 4th & 5th – CS203
• Option 3: 8th & 9th – JORDAN 1C
At the end of each workshop each group will submit a solution for review and which will be
returned at the next workshop. Marks obtained from the workshop submissions will count
towards the end-of-year mark.
PLEASE NOTE: STUDENTS WHO FAIL TO ATTEND AT LEAST 80% OF WORKSHOPS WILL BE
REFUSED PERMISSION TO WRITE THE FINAL EXAM (DPR).
Class Exercises
Students will be required to complete class exercises which counts 10% of the final marks. 80%
of the class exercises should be completed for DP. Class Exercises are to be submitted at the end
of the lecture. Formative feedback will be given for each submission.
Late submissions will not be accepted.
Projects and Assignments
Students will be required to complete the analysis phase of a significant systems development
project. This will entail the construction of two documents (a Business Case and a User
Requirements Specification document). Students will work in teams in the workshops and in
their own time to complete their project assignments. Based on the analysis completed in
INF2009F, students will design and implement an information system in the second semester
(INF2011S) in order to complete the whole systems development life cycle (SDLC).
Examinations and Tests
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 4
There is a two-hour test scheduled on the 25th of April at 16:00 and a three-hour final examination
in June (dates will be published later). Exams and tests are not open-book.
COURSE MATERIALS
The recommended text for the course is:
Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design in a Changing World, 7th Edition
by John W. Satzinger, Robert B. Jackson, Stephen D. Burd
Other suitable texts may be recommended during lectures. Notes deemed necessary will be made
available during lectures and workshops throughout the course. Students are required to cover
ALL course related material posted on the Vula site (specifically the Lesson plans). These would
include short videos, articles, lecture notes and book chapters. It is important that students
familiarise themselves of the theoretical content contained in these elements, PRIOR to the
lecture.
STUDENT DELIVERABLES
The deliverables (quizzes, class exercises, workshops and the two major assignments) as
specified above, need to be submitted electronically on Vula. No exemptions will be granted and
all deliverables need to be handed in for DP purposes. Students need to read the department and
UCT guide to plagiarism and acknowledge the plagiarism declaration for all deliverables.
Due dates for all deliverables are documented in the schedule and on the individual assignment
handouts. In the interests of those students who plan their work well and work efficiently and
steadily throughout the course, absolutely no individual extensions will be given on any
deadlines, for any reason whatsoever. In cases where substantial and unavoidable disruption
to the academic year has occurred, deadlines may be altered for the entire class, at the discretion
of the course co-ordinator.
Deliverables submitted on, or before, the deadline will be marked without penalty. Deliverables
handed in after deadlines will incur an automatic and non-negotiable penalty deduction of 5%
per day, or part thereof. Deliverables handed in more than five days late will not be marked and
the student will receive 0%.
ASSESSMENT
There is a mid-semester test and a final examination at the end of the course. If a student is
exempted for the test, the weight of this mark will be added to the final examination. The graded
activities and percentage contribution towards the final mark is as follows.
Activity Percentage
Workshops 10%
Class Exercises, quizzes 10%
April Test 15%
Assignments 15%
Final Examination 50%
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 5
DP REQUIREMENTS
In order to be permitted to sit the final exam in INF2009F students must have:
• attended and participated in at least 80 % of the workshops
• submitted at least 80% of the class exercises
• completed at least 80% of quizzes
• obtained a sub-minimum of 40% for their year mark prior to the final exam
• submitted all project work
In order to pass INF2009F students must
• Obtain a sub-minimum of 45% in the final examination
• Obtain 50% overall for the course
Please note that 65% of the course mark is obtained under exam conditions; and where a student
is exempted from the term test, their final exam weighting will be increased to 65%.
Students who are thinking of proceeding to IS Honours: should be aiming to average at least 65%
in the IS2 and IS3 semester courses to be reasonably sure of being offered a place on the Honours
course.
ACADEMIC HONESTY
Your attention is drawn to the UCT regulations, which govern academic progress. In particular,
your attention is drawn to:
1. All forms of cheating, plagiarism, collusion or interference with other students’ academic
work and performance will be reported to the Head of Department who will:
a. Impose a penalty with respect to the assessment of the course, or
b. If considered an act of grave misconduct, refer the case to the Tribunal.
All students are responsible to inform themselves about these regulations before performing any
academic work. See the Senate policy on plagiarism.
The Department of Information Systems considers plagiarism to be the deliberate passing off
of another person’s work as though it was your own, and will NOT be tolerated. At the very
least, you would get zero for your work, and we would request that you withdraw from the
Information Systems major. In cases where blatant copying has taken place, we would take
disciplinary action, which could result in suspension or expulsion from UCT.
Since so much of the course mark is awarded for work done outside of our direct control, a great
deal of trust is involved. We therefore view plagiarism in the same way as we do cheating in
examinations. Similar rules apply to all student work such as projects, essays and other
assignments.
Some examples of what we would consider to be plagiarism are:
• You downloaded material from the Internet and submitted it as your own work.
• You acquired assignments from previous year’s students and used them as your own
work.
• Someone else wrote all (or part of) the assignment or project for you, either as a favour
or for some kind of reward.

INF2009F 6
LAB RULES AND POLICIES
Please respect other students when using the Alumni labs. Students are expected to keep noise
levels down to acceptable standards. All students are responsible to inform themselves about the
Appropriate Use of Computer Facilities policy. Students must obey the lab rules and defer to the
lab supervisor at all times.
Note: This course outline is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by
the instructor may be necessary.
GETTING THROUGH INF2009F
Some students approach a course believing that they can get through just by working hard at the
end of the semester to prepare for the final exams. INF2009F covers too much work for this to
be a sensible approach, and such students will usually fail. The emphasis in workshops and exams
is on applying theoretical knowledge, not regurgitating it! An attempt to study at the end of the
course without having applied the various tools and techniques doesn’t really help. If you have
not worked steadily through the workshops and the assignments during the semester, you will
find the examinations incomprehensible.
On the other hand, students who work hard throughout the course should approach the final
exam with a good year mark, and a comfortable feeling that they are already on top of the subject!
Revising for the final exam is still necessary, but it becomes more of a process of refreshing your
memory rather than grappling with new and difficult techniques.
Key success factors to making INF2009F one of the most worthwhile and enjoyable courses you
will do in your degree are:
• Attend lectures, even if you have had a late night, or don’t find all the lectures stimulating.
• Complete class exercises and engage in class discussions.
• Attend workshops. They are the best way to move from theory to practice and ensure you
can apply the required techniques. If you find them easy, then this is an indicator that the
exams will not be difficult for you.
• Do your two project assignments as well as you can. A good year mark takes lots of
pressure off you.
• DONT PROCRASTINATE. Start working on your assignments as soon as you receive them.
Remember that there are no extensions. Also, remember that there is strong demand for
computer laboratory resources towards deadlines.
• Speak to your lecturer or tutor EARLY if you are having problems with the material. But
don’t go to them at the last minute when it is too late to remedy the situation.
• Form a study group with fellow students so that you can support each other and help each
other with difficult parts of the course.
• We encourage group discussion and support, but it is important that each student works
with and understands every aspect of the course. Students will be using the tools and
techniques introduced in INF2009F in delivering a major project in third year and
honours. Your expertise in systems development is probably the most critical skill set
you will take out of university into the IT profession. It is therefore important that both

• Do your two project assignments as well as you can. A good year mark takes lots of
pressure off you.
• DONT PROCRASTINATE. Start working on your assignments as soon as you receive them.
Remember that there are no extensions. Also, remember that there is strong demand for
computer laboratory resources towards deadlines.
• Speak to your lecturer or tutor EARLY if you are having problems with the material. But
don’t go to them at the last minute when it is too late to remedy the situation.
• Form a study group with fellow students so that you can support each other and help each
other with difficult parts of the course.
• We encourage group discussion and support, but it is important that each student works
with and understands every aspect of the course. Students will be using the tools and
techniques introduced in INF2009F in delivering a major project in third year and
honours. Your expertise in systems development is probably the most critical skill set
you will take out of university into the IT profession. It is therefore important that both
members of a team work on all parts of every deliverable – don’t split the work between
you so that each member can see half the total picture. Obviously one team member might
complete the final drawing of a particular model, but both should be involved in the rough
drafts where the real understanding happens.

• Beware PLAGARISM. Each team must submit its own documentation. It is very easy to
see where students are copying rather than doing their own work as each marker
evaluates the same section across all the deliverables. Where groups are found to have
copied from other students, both groups will be penalised. This is likely to result in a
mark of zero being given to both groups with the potential for further action where
appropriate. You will be required to submit a declaration saying the deliverable is all
your own work and details of the format of this statement will follow later. Visit UCT
web site to familiarise yourself with the university’s plagiarism policies.

OVERVIEW
INF2009F is a half course designed for students intending to major in Information Systems or
Computer Science for the BCom, BBusSci or Bsc degrees, although students pursuing other
computing degrees may be accepted, space permitting.
This course is intended to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the front end of
the systems development life cycle. There are some practical components to the course, where
students will be taught to use the common tools of systems analysis. These tools and techniques
include scoping, risk analysis, feasibility assessment, and techniques commonly used in object

INF2009F 2
oriented systems modeling including package, activity, use case, class, interaction and state
machine diagrams. Mastering the systems development process is both a complex and time
consuming exercise and the course follows a three stage approach to developing the required
proficiency:
• Stage 1 is to understand the theory and body of knowledge underpinning the systems
development process, particularly the systems analysis phase. This will be achieved
through the flipped classroom approach, where students will be provided with short
videos, lecture notes and important reading materials. The lecture will then be dedicated
to short class exercises, discussions and brainstorming sessions.
• Stage 2 is to work in groups to apply the theory to a real world example. This will be done
in the workshops where students step through the problem solving process with the
support of tutors where required.
• Stage 3 is to work together in your teams of two, in your own time, to complete each
exercise started in the workshops in order to develop the two main deliverables for the
course – a Business Case and User Requirements Specification.
INF2009F is closely linked to INF2011S and students continuing to this second semester course
will implement parts of an information system based on these user requirements. In doing so a
candidate enrolled for both courses will have completed the whole systems development life
cycle (SDLC) by the end of the year.
It is important to note that although this course includes substantial theoretical content that
students are required to master, students will be expected to apply the acquired theoretical
knowledge in exams, workshops and class exercises to solve real-world problems. The
underlying purpose is always to link theory and practice, preparing students for professional
practice at the end of their studies.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES
On completion of this module the student should be able to:
• Understand the main concepts supporting the Object Oriented paradigm including classes
and instances, association, encapsulation, message-passing, information hiding,
collaboration, aggregation and inheritance.
• Explain the key role of a Systems Analyst/Business Analyst in business.
• Understand and describe the systems development life cycle (SDLC) and how it can be
used to manage the systems development effort.
• Describe the context of the analysis, design and implementation stages within the SDLC.
• Describe the different overall approaches used to develop information systems.
• Explain the many reasons for creating Information Systems models.
• Develop a Business Case to identify problems in a particular business area and context
and to recommend a strategy to solving these problems.
• Document functional requirements with Use Case diagrams and Use Case narratives.
• Model workflows and business processes using Activity diagrams.
• Develop a Domain Class Diagram to document the major concepts in the system and refine
this model to represent the logical software classes (Analysis Class Diagram)
• Realise Use Case interactions using Sequence diagrams.
• Document message passing at the user interface using System Sequence Diagrams and
object behaviour using State Machine diagrams.
• Understand how the various tools and techniques relate to each other.

• Develop a detailed User Requirements Specification document.
CONTENT AND TEACHING FORMAT
Lectures
The Lectures follow a Flipped Classroom Model. Lectures will comprise of class exercises, group
discussion and brainstorming sessions. Students are thus required to watch the videos and
cover the notes available on Vula prior to the lecture, to fully and productively engage with
the class exercises and discussion sessions.
The topics to be covered are listed in the lecture schedule document and the Vula Lesson Plans.
PLEASE NOTE: IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENTS ABOUT THE COURSE MATERIAL, TUTORIALS,
TESTS, EXAMS AND PROJECTS, WILL BE MADE DURING LECTURES AND WORKSHOPS FROM
TIME TO TIME. WHILE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION WILL ALSO BE POSTED ON THE INF2009F
VULA SITE, STUDENTS WHO SKIP LECTURES DO SO AT THEIR OWN RISK.
Workshops
Students will be working in teams of two for the project and in groups of four in the workshops
(two teams together). Weekly workshop sessions will be held on most Thursdays (see detailed
schedule for exact dates) as follows:
• Option 1: 3rd & 4th – SNAPE DO 2
• Option 2: 4th & 5th – CS203
• Option 3: 8th & 9th – JORDAN 1C
At the end of each workshop each group will submit a solution for review and which will be
returned at the next workshop. Marks obtained from the workshop submissions will count
towards the end-of-year mark.
PLEASE NOTE: STUDENTS WHO FAIL TO ATTEND AT LEAST 80% OF WORKSHOPS WILL BE
REFUSED PERMISSION TO WRITE THE FINAL EXAM (DPR).
Class Exercises
Students will be required to complete class exercises which counts 10% of the final marks. 80%
of the class exercises should be completed for DP. Class Exercises are to be submitted at the end
of the lecture. Formative feedback will be given for each submission.
Late submissions will not be accepted.
Projects and Assignments
Students will be required to complete the analysis phase of a significant systems development
project. This will entail the construction of two documents (a Business Case and a User
Requirements Specification document). Students will work in teams in the workshops and in
their own time to complete their project assignments. Based on the analysis completed in
INF2009F, students will design and implement an information system in the second semester
(INF2011S) in order to complete the whole systems development life cycle (SDLC).
Examinations and Tests
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 4
There is a two-hour test scheduled on the 25th of April at 16:00 and a three-hour final examination
in June (dates will be published later). Exams and tests are not open-book.
COURSE MATERIALS
The recommended text for the course is:
Introduction to Systems Analysis and Design in a Changing World, 7th Edition
by John W. Satzinger, Robert B. Jackson, Stephen D. Burd
Other suitable texts may be recommended during lectures. Notes deemed necessary will be made
available during lectures and workshops throughout the course. Students are required to cover
ALL course related material posted on the Vula site (specifically the Lesson plans). These would
include short videos, articles, lecture notes and book chapters. It is important that students
familiarise themselves of the theoretical content contained in these elements, PRIOR to the
lecture.
STUDENT DELIVERABLES
The deliverables (quizzes, class exercises, workshops and the two major assignments) as
specified above, need to be submitted electronically on Vula. No exemptions will be granted and
all deliverables need to be handed in for DP purposes. Students need to read the department and
UCT guide to plagiarism and acknowledge the plagiarism declaration for all deliverables.
Due dates for all deliverables are documented in the schedule and on the individual assignment
handouts. In the interests of those students who plan their work well and work efficiently and
steadily throughout the course, absolutely no individual extensions will be given on any
deadlines, for any reason whatsoever. In cases where substantial and unavoidable disruption
to the academic year has occurred, deadlines may be altered for the entire class, at the discretion
of the course co-ordinator.
Deliverables submitted on, or before, the deadline will be marked without penalty. Deliverables
handed in after deadlines will incur an automatic and non-negotiable penalty deduction of 5%
per day, or part thereof. Deliverables handed in more than five days late will not be marked and
the student will receive 0%.
ASSESSMENT
There is a mid-semester test and a final examination at the end of the course. If a student is
exempted for the test, the weight of this mark will be added to the final examination. The graded
activities and percentage contribution towards the final mark is as follows.
Activity Percentage
Workshops 10%
Class Exercises, quizzes 10%
April Test 15%
Assignments 15%
Final Examination 50%
Department of Information Systems 2019
INF2009F 5
DP REQUIREMENTS
In order to be permitted to sit the final exam in INF2009F students must have:
• attended and participated in at least 80 % of the workshops
• submitted at least 80% of the class exercises
• completed at least 80% of quizzes
• obtained a sub-minimum of 40% for their year mark prior to the final exam
• submitted all project work
In order to pass INF2009F students must
• Obtain a sub-minimum of 45% in the final examination
• Obtain 50% overall for the course
Please note that 65% of the course mark is obtained under exam conditions; and where a student
is exempted from the term test, their final exam weighting will be increased to 65%.
Students who are thinking of proceeding to IS Honours: should be aiming to average at least 65%
in the IS2 and IS3 semester courses to be reasonably sure of being offered a place on the Honours
course.
ACADEMIC HONESTY
Your attention is drawn to the UCT regulations, which govern academic progress. In particular,
your attention is drawn to:
1. All forms of cheating, plagiarism, collusion or interference with other students’ academic
work and performance will be reported to the Head of Department who will:
a. Impose a penalty with respect to the assessment of the course, or
b. If considered an act of grave misconduct, refer the case to the Tribunal.
All students are responsible to inform themselves about these regulations before performing any
academic work. See the Senate policy on plagiarism.
The Department of Information Systems considers plagiarism to be the deliberate passing off
of another person’s work as though it was your own, and will NOT be tolerated. At the very
least, you would get zero for your work, and we would request that you withdraw from the
Information Systems major. In cases where blatant copying has taken place, we would take
disciplinary action, which could result in suspension or expulsion from UCT.
Since so much of the course mark is awarded for work done outside of our direct control, a great
deal of trust is involved. We therefore view plagiarism in the same way as we do cheating in
examinations. Similar rules apply to all student work such as projects, essays and other
assignments.
Some examples of what we would consider to be plagiarism are:
• You downloaded material from the Internet and submitted it as your own work.
• You acquired assignments from previous year’s students and used them as your own
work.
• Someone else wrote all (or part of) the assignment or project for you, either as a favour
or for some kind of reward.

INF2009F 6
LAB RULES AND POLICIES
Please respect other students when using the Alumni labs. Students are expected to keep noise
levels down to acceptable standards. All students are responsible to inform themselves about the
Appropriate Use of Computer Facilities policy. Students must obey the lab rules and defer to the
lab supervisor at all times.
Note: This course outline is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by
the instructor may be necessary.
GETTING THROUGH INF2009F
Some students approach a course believing that they can get through just by working hard at the
end of the semester to prepare for the final exams. INF2009F covers too much work for this to
be a sensible approach, and such students will usually fail. The emphasis in workshops and exams
is on applying theoretical knowledge, not regurgitating it! An attempt to study at the end of the
course without having applied the various tools and techniques doesn’t really help. If you have
not worked steadily through the workshops and the assignments during the semester, you will
find the examinations incomprehensible.
On the other hand, students who work hard throughout the course should approach the final
exam with a good year mark, and a comfortable feeling that they are already on top of the subject!
Revising for the final exam is still necessary, but it becomes more of a process of refreshing your
memory rather than grappling with new and difficult techniques.
Key success factors to making INF2009F one of the most worthwhile and enjoyable courses you
will do in your degree are:
• Attend lectures, even if you have had a late night, or don’t find all the lectures stimulating.
• Complete class exercises and engage in class discussions.
• Attend workshops. They are the best way to move from theory to practice and ensure you
can apply the required techniques. If you find them easy, then this is an indicator that the
exams will not be difficult for you.
• Do your two project assignments as well as you can. A good year mark takes lots of
pressure off you.
• DONT PROCRASTINATE. Start working on your assignments as soon as you receive them.
Remember that there are no extensions. Also, remember that there is strong demand for
computer laboratory resources towards deadlines.
• Speak to your lecturer or tutor EARLY if you are having problems with the material. But
don’t go to them at the last minute when it is too late to remedy the situation.
• Form a study group with fellow students so that you can support each other and help each

exam with a good year mark, and a comfortable feeling that they are already on top of the subject!
Revising for the final exam is still necessary, but it becomes more of a process of refreshing your
memory rather than grappling with new and difficult techniques.
Key success factors to making INF2009F one of the most worthwhile and enjoyable courses you
will do in your degree are:
• Attend lectures, even if you have had a late night, or don’t find all the lectures stimulating.
• Complete class exercises and engage in class discussions.
• Attend workshops. They are the best way to move from theory to practice and ensure you
can apply the required techniques. If you find them easy, then this is an indicator that the
exams will not be difficult for you.
• Do your two project assignments as well as you can. A good year mark takes lots of
pressure off you.
• DONT PROCRASTINATE. Start working on your assignments as soon as you receive them.
Remember that there are no extensions. Also, remember that there is strong demand for
computer laboratory resources towards deadlines.
• Speak to your lecturer or tutor EARLY if you are having problems with the material. But
don’t go to them at the last minute when it is too late to remedy the situation.
• Form a study group with fellow students so that you can support each other and help each
other with difficult parts of the course.
• We encourage group discussion and support, but it is important that each student works
with and understands every aspect of the course. Students will be using the tools and
techniques introduced in INF2009F in delivering a major project in third year and
honours. Your expertise in systems development is probably the most critical skill set
you will take out of university into the IT profession. It is therefore important that both
members of a team work on all parts of every deliverable – don’t split the work between
you so that each member can see half the total picture. Obviously one team member might
complete the final drawing of a particular model, but both should be involved in the rough
drafts where the real understanding happens.

• Beware PLAGARISM. Each team must submit its own documentation. It is very easy to
see where students are copying rather than doing their own work as each marker
evaluates the same section across all the deliverables. Where groups are found to have
copied from other students, both groups will be penalised. This is likely to result in a
mark of zero being given to both groups with the potential for further action where
appropriate. You will be required to submit a declaration saying the deliverable is all
your own work and details of the format of this statement will follow later. Visit UCT
web site to familiarise yourself with the university’s plagiarism policies.
